### AWK is like the overly literal genie who grants three wishes

# Gets the unique lines from the first column, sorted.
awk '{print $1}' input_file | sort | uniq

# Filters lines based on specific fields, then prints those fields.
awk '$3 == "DEL/ITX" && $4 > 2 {print $3" "$4}' input_file

# Lots of cool stuff here too!
#   - Use line number in output
#   - Modifies columns before re-printing the line
#   - Custom separator in output
awk '{OFS = "\t"; $2=$2+NR; $3=$3+NR; print $0}' input_file

# Reduce a column to a single character (the second character).
awk '{OFS = "\t"; $4=substr($4,2,1); print $0}' input_file


# Lots to unpack here:
#   - Use of conditional statement to output to multiple files.
#   - $0 prints the ENTIRE line.
#   - Use of pipe to directly gzip output
zcat mnase_mids_kernel_smoothing.chr1.tsv.gz | awk '{ if($3 < 123035435){print $0 | "gzip > mnase_mids_kernel_smoothing.chr1.1.tsv.gz"}\
                                                      		           else{print $0 | "gzip > mnase_mids_kernel_smoothing.chr1.2.tsv.gz"} }'
